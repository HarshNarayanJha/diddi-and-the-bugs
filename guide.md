Every game, book and story has a universe... and this game
has a universe too! This guide explains how to dive deep into it,
get the greatest scores, and enjoy the game as best as you can.

## The menu

_New in version 3.0.0._

This is the main menu. You can pick an option by pressing one of these keys:

- **1**: Start the real game.
- **2**: See the credits scene. Basically, it redirects to the [THANKS.txt](THANKS.txt) file from this repo.

## Keys

If you press some keys, some actions may happen.

### General event keys

- **P**: Pause the game, saving scores and coordinates. If the game is paused,
  press **P** again to keep playing [^1].
- **Q**: Quit the game, and close the window.
- **R**: Restart the game, and return to the menu [^1].

### Spacecraft (Willpower) keys [^1]

- **Up / down keys**: Use them to move the Willpower, and avoid enemies. You can also use WASD keys (**W and S,** to be more precise)
- **Space**: Send a bullet of _L1-F3_ energized serum, that can destroy both bugs
  and trash!
- **Z**: This yields the Special Attack, if available (see below)

### The Z-Move (Special Attack)

_New in version 4.0.0._

This special move **hits all the mobs with an energy blast!** Though this won't affect
trash items, sorry... Anyway, this is a great way to clear up your space -- just remember
**you can only use this move once** per game!

**_Hint:_** Don't use this move as soon as the game starts. Try to resist the temptation
of using it, unless...

- The Monster (see its section below) moves fast and you can't reach it at all.
- You are *really* overwhelmed by mobs, and could loose the whole game (this happens
  sometimes after there're 100 mobs or less).

## Elements guide

A quick guide to all the elements on the game.

### The Willpower

The Willpower is a modified spacecraft modified by Diddi, to shoot the serum. You
will have to pilot the spacecraft to fight the bugs!

**Fun fact:** This spacecraft came from the same place than its pilot, Diddi. Check out
[@DiddiLeija](https://github.com/DiddiLeija)'s [wiki](https://diddileija.github.io/wiki) to learn more.

### _L1-F3_ energized serum bullet

The Willpower can shoot these fast bullets, to destroy something! Once it touches a bug/trash,
it disappears and cannot damage other enemies. You can shoot an unlimited number of bullets.

### Enemies

They're the creepy creatures that menace the Earth! You're the only one who
can destroy them to save the planet.

These bugs, viruses, bacteria and fungi are the most common element in this game.
They go directly to you, and can have multiple aspects. If they touch your spacecraft,
you will loose the game. They can be destroyed with a bullet, and you can earn **10 points**.
The idea is to **destroy 200 bugs**.

### Space trash

Unfortunately, our loveful Earth's atmosphere is filled up with trash [^2]. But you
can help to wipe them out using your bullets. If you destroy one, you can earn
**50, 100 or even 200 extra points**! However, if they touch you, you will loose the game.

### Messages bar

_New in version 2.0.0._

Here, you can be notified by both Diddi or the "System" when something happens, like an
"event log". For example, when you pause or restart the game, the "System" will tell you. Also, if you find one
of our "easter eggs", you'll get notified too!

### The Monster

_New in version 2.0.0._

Wait...? Where did this giant monster came from...?

This strange but giant enemy **only appears once**. It can move even
faster than the bullets, but also move slowly... it's a randomness thing.
It uses 16x16 pixels, so it's way bigger than everything else in the game
(other mobs and items use 8x8 pixels, or even less!).

The Monster is stronger than regular enemies and trash, so you must
**hit it twice** to defeat it. (_New in version 4.0.0_).

If destroyed, the Monster will leave **1000 extra points**! However, if it
crosses the screen without being defeated, it won't appear again and won't
leave any points. You'll have to start again for a chance to destroy it.

[^2]: Unfortunately, this is totally true.
